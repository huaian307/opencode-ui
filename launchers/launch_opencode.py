"""Start the opencode-ui panel (and OpenCode, only when the panel still needs it).

This is what the "OpenCode (with panel)" desktop shortcut runs. It is meant to
run under pythonw.exe so that no console window flashes.

Engine-aware (2026-09-26): the panel can run **without** OpenCode at all.
  * engine == "opencode"  -> start OpenCode if needed, then the watcher
                             (and keep self-healing the OpenCode junction)
  * engine == "acp" (etc.) -> panel-only: skip OpenCode and the junction heal,
                             just start the watcher, which opens the panel

So the same shortcut keeps working after switching the engine to ACP, and there
is no need to start something the user does not want.

ASCII-only on purpose (see AGENTS.md pitfall #28 for the .vbs/.ps1 variant).
